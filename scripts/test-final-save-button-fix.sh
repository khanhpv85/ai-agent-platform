echo -e "${BLUE}1. Root Cause Analysis:${NC}"
echo "   - Parent component was calling onUpdate immediately"
echo "   - This caused llmConfig prop to change"
echo "   - Prop changes triggered re-renders and state resets"
echo "   - Save button was disabling due to state interference"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}2. Final Fix Applied:${NC}"
echo "   ✅ Removed immediate onUpdate calls during field changes"
echo "   ✅ Only call onUpdate after successful save"
echo "   ✅ Isolated local state management"
echo "   ✅ Simplified change detection logic"
echo "   ✅ Removed complex useEffect dependencies"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}3. Key Changes Made:${NC}"
echo "   Before: updateConfig() → onUpdate() → parent re-render → state reset"
echo "   After:  updateConfig() → local state only → save → onUpdate()"
echo "   ✅ No parent interference during editing"
echo "   ✅ Clean local state management"
echo "   ✅ Reliable change detection"

echo -e "${BLUE}4. Testing Steps:${NC}"
echo "   1. Open browser console (F12)"
echo "   2. Navigate to Agent Configuration Modal"
echo "   3. Go to LLM Settings tab"
echo "   4. Check initial console logs"
echo "   5. Change any field (e.g., temperature slider)"
echo "   6. Verify 'LLMSettingsBlock Update:' appears in console"
echo "   7. Verify 'LLMSettingsBlock Change Check:' shows hasChanges: true"
echo "   8. Check if Save button enables"
echo "   9. Verify 'Unsaved Changes' badge appears"
echo "   10. Test save functionality"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}5. Expected Console Logs:${NC}"
echo "   Initial load:"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Render:' - hasChanges: false"
echo "   After field change:"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Update:' - shows the change"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Change Check:' - hasChanges: true"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Render:' - hasChanges: true"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}6. Debug Information to Check:${NC}"
echo "   ✅ hasChanges should be false initially"
echo "   ✅ hasChanges should become true after any field change"
echo "   ✅ localConfig should differ from initialConfig"
echo "   ✅ Save button should be enabled when hasChanges is true"
echo "   ✅ 'Unsaved Changes' badge should appear"
echo "   ✅ No parent onUpdate calls during editing"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}7. Troubleshooting:${NC}"
echo "   If Save button still doesn't work:"
echo "   1. Check console for 'LLMSettingsBlock Update:' messages"
echo "   2. Verify 'LLMSettingsBlock Change Check:' shows hasChanges: true"
echo "   3. Check if any parent component is interfering"
echo "   4. Verify initialConfigRef is not being updated"
echo "   5. Check for any error messages in console"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}8. Expected Behavior:${NC}"
echo "   ✅ Field changes should immediately enable Save button"
echo "   ✅ 'Unsaved Changes' badge should appear"
echo "   ✅ Save button should remain enabled until save"
echo "   ✅ After save, hasChanges should reset to false"
echo "   ✅ Parent should only be updated after successful save"

echo "2. Check console logs for debugging info"
echo "3. Verify Save button enables immediately after changes"
echo "4. Test save functionality"
echo "5. Verify state resets after successful save"
echo "6. Check that parent is only updated after save"
