echo -e "${BLUE}1. Issue Identified:${NC}"
echo "   - Circular dependency in useEffect with hasChanges"
echo "   - useEffect was resetting state when hasChanges changed"
echo "   - This caused the Save button to disable after changes"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}2. Fix Applied:${NC}"
echo "   ✅ Removed hasChanges from useEffect dependency array"
echo "   ✅ Simplified the sync logic"
echo "   ✅ Maintained change detection in separate useEffect"
echo "   ✅ Preserved user changes during prop updates"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}3. Testing Steps:${NC}"
echo "   1. Open browser console (F12)"
echo "   2. Navigate to Agent Configuration Modal"
echo "   3. Go to LLM Settings tab"
echo "   4. Check initial state in console logs"
echo "   5. Change any field (e.g., temperature slider)"
echo "   6. Verify hasChanges becomes true in console"
echo "   7. Check if Save button enables"
echo "   8. Verify 'Unsaved Changes' badge appears"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}4. Expected Console Logs:${NC}"
echo "   Look for these debug messages:"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Render:' - Shows current state"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Change Detection:' - Shows change detection"
echo "   - 'LLMSettingsBlock Update:' - Shows when fields change"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}5. Key Changes Made:${NC}"
echo "   Before: useEffect(() => { ... }, [llmConfig, hasChanges])"
echo "   After:  useEffect(() => { ... }, [llmConfig])"
echo "   ✅ Removed circular dependency"
echo "   ✅ Simplified logic"
echo "   ✅ Maintained functionality"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}6. Debug Information to Check:${NC}"
echo "   - hasChanges should be false initially"
echo "   - hasChanges should become true when any field changes"
echo "   - localConfig should differ from initialConfig after changes"
echo "   - Save button should be enabled when hasChanges is true"
echo "   - 'Unsaved Changes' badge should appear"
echo ""

echo -e "${BLUE}7. Troubleshooting:${NC}"
echo "   If Save button still doesn't work:"
echo "   1. Check console for error messages"
echo "   2. Verify hasChanges state in React DevTools"
echo "   3. Check if updateConfig is being called"
echo "   4. Verify initialConfigRef is not being updated unexpectedly"
echo "   5. Check if any other useEffect is interfering"
echo ""

echo -e "${GREEN}✅ Save button fix verification completed!${NC}"
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Test the component in browser"
echo "2. Check console logs for debugging info"
echo "3. Verify Save button enables after changes"
echo "4. Test save functionality"
echo "5. Verify state resets after successful save"
